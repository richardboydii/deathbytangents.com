I received my Eagle Scout anniversary email today. I wholeheartedly disagree 
with the idea that "6/20/1995 ... feels just like yesterday"; it feels like 
another lifetime entirely. In a biological sense (cell age) I am a completely 
different organism. My mental landscape is also completely different as my 
brain is (surely) starting to calcify and I'm slowly turning into a 
stereotypical "I don't understand kids these days" old man. I think, 
emotionally, most of the angry young teenager is gone save for a few remnants 
on my particularly bad days.

Looking back on those years in Scouting is difficult for a variety of reasons. 
Scouting is one of those things that my father and I did; it's been more than 
six and a half years since his death and I still get sucked into a vortex of 
sadness and regret whenever something reminds me of him. And this was really 
the one thing that we did together.

The other reason I find it difficult to talk about Scouting is the way in which 
it has become so politicized lately. The fact that Donald Trump, a man who has 
never had to earn nor sacrifice anything in his hollow, sad life, turned the 
last yearly rally into a mini Hitler Youth affair detests me. It was a lot of 
the same tired jingoism that you see so often from people who claim the mantel 
of "Real Americans" without having ever to do anything to earn it. And by that
I mean volunteer at a school, serve in the military, give back to their 
community, etc.

Despite my reservations about celebrating my Scouting anniversary, I do admit 
that becoming an Eagle Scout was a singular event in my life. Just the act of 
having to stick with something for almost a decade took commitment that became 
harder as I got older. So many friends fell by the wayside and out of Scouting 
as High School loomed on the horizon. And yet, despite never having done much 
with my life up to that point, I stuck with it long enough to be able to take 
on that final leg of Scouting that ends at Eagle. It was really the firs major 
thing that I was able to earn during the first half of my life. Until I earned 
my Sergeant years later, Eagle Scout would continue to be a defining moment of 
what I am capable of if I choose to apply myself.

My daughter is a Daisy Scout, and I hope some day that she becomes an 
Ambassador, earning her Silver and Gold along the way. If not, that's going to 
be her choice rather than a vicarously motivated dream that her father had. The
fact that she's in Scouting and enjoys it brings me joy regardless of what the 
future may bring. Like my father and I, Girl Scouting is "our" thing that Dad 
and Bea do together.
