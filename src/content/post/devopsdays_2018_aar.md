[DevOpsDays Austin 2018](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2018-austin/welcome/) 
has come and gone this year and thre are quite a lot of takeaways. I personally 
learned a lot of lessons this year around venue management and the downsides of 
scheduling another offsite Happy Hour. In the spirit of opennes and continuous 
improvement

# Don't Assume the Price is Zero, Event if People are Nice
There's a natural tension between ~~not being a jerk~~ being nice to your 
vendors and making sure that you can afford everything you want to do. After 
all, it's in their best interests to sell you as much as they can while also 
making sure that you aren't oversold or taken advantage of too much. 

Great example: this year we had to use easels and some other items for the
conference and our venue had those on hand. I took them up on the offer but 
failed to realize that there was a cost involved. Only until we go the final 
invoice did I relize that the price was going to be around $300 for all those 
easels we borrowed. 

Another trap to avoid is % cost vs fixed cost. Gratuity and sales tax always 
scale with an increase in services. We got bit by this particular bug during 
Happy Hour when we increased our bar tab. Even though the cost was fixed in our 
quote we didn't (and our vendor didn't) take that into account when telling us 
where we were at in consumption.

## TODO 
* Make sure to ask "what does that cost?" whenever you're working with a vendor 
to figure out what you need. Always get the price up front and make sure it 
gets put in writing so that there's no ambiguity. Assume that everything costs.
* Understand what costs are fixed and what are percentage-based. Calculate that 
into any increase in services for flexible things like bar tabs.

# Off-Site Happy Hours are Fun But Work Against You
This year we decided to go all-in (again) on an off-site Happy Hour, including 
shuttle service to and from the venue, a generous tab, and dinner service. We 
planned for the following numbers.
* Food service for 200 guests
* Shuttle service for 300 guests
* Tab for 300 guests

We ended up with a total attendance of 172 out of 390 conference attendees. 
They ate all the food and ran up a pretty impresseive bar tab. So, even though 
we offered them free rides to and from the Happy Hour, we only got 44% of our 
attendees to show up. In addition, no matter how much food and drink are 
available, the attendees are going to consume as much as possible. 

Another side affect of having the Happy Hour off-site is that it removes the 
attendees from the conference experience itself. Even though we usually have 
one sponsor for Happy Hour, we still want other sponsors to be able to engage 
with the attendees and keep the conversation running. Moving it off-site just 
doesn't really cut it when it comes to fostering collaboration and 
conversation. 

## TODO
* Keep the Happy Hour to be on-site for the conference. Moving it off-site 
increases the complexity required to manage things and incentivize attendance. 
Keep the conversation going by making the Happy Hour an extension of the 
conference itself.
* Go with fixed-costs and avoid variablity with bar tabs and food. The people 
that stick around for Happy Hour will make sure that nothing goesto waste so 
build in constraints.
* Plan for 50% of the conference attendees to stick around for Happy Hour. You 
will never get 100% attendance, even if you offer them free rides there and 
back. This gives you the contstraints needed to keep costs low and ensures that 
people don't over eat or over drink.

# People Expect to be Fed the Same as They Did Last Year
At DevOpsDays Austin 2017 we fed our attendees very, very well. We had barbecue 
from Stiles Switch, taco lunch from Tacos N Tequila, and custom themed sundaes 
from Amy's Ice Cream. The upside was that we food scored high on our survey, 
feeding everyone took an inordante amount of time even when we incresed our 
serving lines. This meant that lunch usually ran almost two hours, which took 
away from the time we could have content for our attendees. 

For 2018, in order to reduce costs, we went with boxed lunches from Central 
Market and boxed snacks from Sweet Treats and Tiff's Treats. The real win was 
that we were able to dramitcally redcue the amount of time it took to feed 
everyone at the conference. In fact, on day 2, we were able to shift lunch 
upstairs in order to make up for time caused by a severe weather delay. All in 
all we were able to feed everyone in less than 30 minutes for lunch and snacks 
flew off the shelves.

Unfortunately some of our return guests this year were expecting to be fed at 
the same level they were last year. This led to some dissastifaction on our 
survey results for food, even though we made up for it by giving them more 
content with time savings.

## TODO
* Stick with box lunches because of the time savings involved. We get more 
content and time to mingle instead of having people wait in line.
* Look at other vendors (besides sandwiches) to help vary the meals between 
day one and day two.
