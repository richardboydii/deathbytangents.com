I'm a Site Reliability Engineer (I DevOps all the things) living in lovely 
Austin, TX with two badass ladies (my wife an daughter), three lazy cats, 
and more breweries than I have time to go out and see. I have always enjoyed 
blogging and writing over the years and this site is my attempt at at doing 
that in a more consistent fashion.
