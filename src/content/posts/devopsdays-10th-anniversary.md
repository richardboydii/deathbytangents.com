This year marks the 10th anniversay of the very first DevOpsDays Conference
ever held. Way back in 2009, before k8s was hot and we had all gone Serverless,
DevOps as a __thing__ was brand new to the world. The following is my recap
from [DevOpsDays Ghent](https://devopsdays.org/2019-ghent/) as well as my
thoughts on my own journey with DevOps.

## Day 0 Was Game-Changing

The event started with we're now calling __Day 0__. Organizers from all over
the world gathered to have a special day that was focused on how we do what
we do; it was a mini-conference for conference organizers and it was (for me)
the most important part of the conference.

Being a conference organizer can be an isolating experience. Each team of
organizers has its own dynamic and history.
