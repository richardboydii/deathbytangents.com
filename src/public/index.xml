      <description>As a systems administrator systems engineeer devops engineer SRE? I&amp;rsquo;ve come to love AWS Lambda. Even though there are limitations (duration and resource caps) most of the server-side daemon code you end up developing can be ported over without too much hassle. There is one hitch that can make your serverless life painful: external libraries.
Why External Libraries The Python standard library has just about everything you need to write elegant software that can do just about everything.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Site Reliability Engineer (I DevOps all the things) living in lovely Austin, TX with two badass ladies (my wife an daughter), three lazy cats, and more breweries than I have time to go out and see. I have always enjoyed blogging and writing over the years and this site is my attempt at at doing that in a more consistent fashion.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know how many blogs that I&amp;rsquo;ve attempted to start over the years. I usually get a few posts in and then that&amp;rsquo;s it; no more steam left in the tank to commit or, more often, it begins to feel like work. The minute something feels like work it triggers this deadman switch somewhere in my brain that says &amp;ldquo;no fun, must stop&amp;rdquo;. And then the poor old site becomes an orphan, part of the digital detritus that I&amp;rsquo;ve left over the 2+ decades that I&amp;rsquo;ve had a presence on the Internet.</description>
